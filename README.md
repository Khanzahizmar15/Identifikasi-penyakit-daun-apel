## 📌 Background

Apple crops are vulnerable to several diseases, with **Powdery Mildew** and **Rust** being among the most common. These diseases can significantly affect the health and yield of apple trees if not detected early.

This project aims to utilize **Computer Vision** technology and **Deep Learning**, specifically **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**, to automatically classify apple leaf images into the following categories:

- 🟢 **Healthy**  
- ⚪ **Powdery Mildew**  
- 🔴 **Rust**

By providing a fast and reliable detection system, this project supports early diagnosis, allowing for timely intervention and disease control.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- To develop an image classification model for detecting diseases on apple leaves.  
- To apply CNN-based deep learning methods for classifying leaf images into three categories: *Healthy*, *Powdery*, and *Rust*.  
- To provide a practical and usable system using a structured apple leaf image dataset.
